# title chooser
it's a simple app that lets you type in part of a string and it will match it against an array of specific titles
if your string matches, it will display the titles it matches with and the corresponding command you need to type into the game to get the title above your little, pretty mouse
you can also type in a number to see the corresponding title

it works by looping the title array and matching every single title to your string
then it puts the matches into another array and prints that array

you could also try and write your username, it might say something to you :-)
